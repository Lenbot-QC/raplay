# raplay (dev)

Local music player in Terminal. Purely Rust. (using **1.77-stable** toolchain)

> #### Tip
> 
> - For Windows, I only recommend to use [Windows Terminal]() to run this project. The mininum support is `CMD` **(NOT RECOMMENDED!!)**.
> - Only have tested on [Windows 11 Pro 21H2 (Build 22000) (ARM64)*]() and Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (Build 7601) (AMD64)*.
> - 32-Bit Operation Systems, Linux distros, MacOS X, haven't tested currently because of development version. (Of course, they will also be tested when this project becomes more useful.)
